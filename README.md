**Original Story Line**

Once upon a time, a group of friends set out on a hunt for hidden treasure. The treasure was scattered across different parts of the land. In the middle of it all was a secret room, located between a garden that was itself surrounded by a vast winter land.

The treasure was heavily guarded by enemies, fire traps, and poisonous fruits. Eventually, the enemies learned that someone was planning to steal the treasure. In response, some of them came out and captured the intruders, locking one person in a prison cell. The others fled in fear, leaving one friend behind.

That person is our player.

Now completely alone, the player realizes that he must rely solely on himself. Escaping won’t be easy, as many obstacles lie ahead. First, he must find a way out of the prison room by braving the fire and collecting the key to open the treasure box. Once out, he enters the garden, where he must battle moving enemies and gather fruits to increase his score. Afterward, he advances to the next level—Winter Land—where he faces new threats such as moving lanterns and dangerous fruits. He must eat only the good ones and avoid the poisonous ones.

At the end of Level 3, the player finally escapes the winter land, free from captivity, with the treasure in hand.


**How to Play?**

1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player through the maze.
2. The player keeps going in a particular direction until he hits a wall or you press a different direction arrow.
3. Find the path to the key *first* and then the treasure box/door.
4. Collect coins/fruits to increase score.
5. Avoid poisonous fruit because it reduces your score(only at level 3).
6. There is a timer; try to complete as fast as you can.
